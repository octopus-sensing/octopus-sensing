    '''
    Manages OpenBCI streaming using brainflow
    Data will be recorded in a csv file/files with the following column order:
    channels, Acc_x, Acc_y, Acc_z, sample_id, time_stamp, trigger

    Attributes
    -----------

    Parameters
    ----------
    name: str, default: None
        Device name. This name will be used in the output path to identify
        each device's data.

    output_path: str,  default: output
        The path for recording files.
        Audio files will be recorded in folder {output_path}/{name}

    saving_mode: int, default: SavingModeEnum.CONTINIOUS_SAVING_MODE
        The way of saving data: saving continiously in a file or save data related to
        each stimulus in a separate file.
        SavingModeEnum is:

            0. CONTINIOUS_SAVING_MODE
            1. SEPARATED_SAVING_MODE

    board_type: str, default: cyton-daisy
        The type of OpenBCI boards that connect by USB dongle.
        It can be:

            - cyton: for cyton board sampling rate is 250 and it has 8 channels
            - cyton-daisy: for cyton-daisy board sampling rate is 125 and it has 16 channels
            - ganglion: for Ganglion board sampling rate is 200 and it has 4 channels

    serial_port: str, default: None
        The serial port for reading OpenBCI data. By default we set this as follows for various platforms:

            - Linux: /dev/ttyUSB0
            - Windows: Com3
            - MacOS: /dev/cu.*

    channels_order: List(str), default: None
        A list of channel names which specify the order and names of channels

    Example
    --------
    Creating an instance of OpenBCI board with USB dongle using
    `brainflow <https://brainflow.readthedocs.io/en/stable/SupportedBoards.html#openbci>`_,
    and adding it to the device coordinator. Device coordinator is responsible
    for triggerng the OpenBCI to start or stop recording  or to add markers to
    recorded data.
    In this example, since the saving mode is continuous, all recorded data
    will be saved in a file. But, when an event happens, device coordinator will send
    a trigger message to the device and recorded data will be marked with the trigger

    >>> my_openbci =
    ...     BrainFlowOpenBCIStreaming(name="OpenBCI",
    ...                               output_path="./output",
    ...                               board_type="cyton-daisy",
    ...                               saving_mode=SavingModeEnum.CONTINIOUS_SAVING_MODE,
    ...                               channels_order=["Fp1", "Fp2", "F7", "F3",
    ...                                               "F4", "F8", "T3", "C3",
    ...                                               "C4", "T4", "T5", "P3",
    ...                                               "P4", "T6", "O1", "O2"])
    >>> device_coordinator.add_device(my_openbci)

    Note
    -----
    Before running the code, turn on the OpenBCI, connect the dongle and make sure its port is free.
